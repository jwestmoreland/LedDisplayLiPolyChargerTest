Note:
There are two revs of the board - Rev0 - no PWM for display brightness/dimming.
                                                  - Rev1 - adds PWM feature to control display brightness/dimming.
This repository is considered to be temporary pending release of the design.  It is the offspring of the GPS-NMEA-Display project.
Libraries that are necessary to use to build the project(s) are included here in the libraries folder.  Some have pull-requests pending; so they are
included in this repository. 
If you make a build that fails that's library related; make sure you're not using an alternate library that may not have the pull-request features that are included
here.
